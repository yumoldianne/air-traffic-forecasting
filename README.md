# ðŸ›« Forecasting and Volatility Modeling of Air Traffic: A SARIMA and ARMA-GARCH Approach

This study develops a time series forecasting framework for monthly U.S. airline passenger volumes from January 2003 to September 2023. The analysis addresses both deterministic componentsâ€”such as trend and seasonalityâ€”and stochastic features like volatility clustering. A log transformation followed by seasonal and regular differencing produced a stationary series suitable for SARIMA modeling. The best-fitting SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,0)(12) model captured long-term structure but left evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity in its residuals. 

To address this, several GARCH-type models were evaluated. Among them, an ARMA(2,1)â€“GARCH(1,1) model on the differenced log series achieved well-behaved residuals and ranked among the lowest in AIC. Although ARMA(2,0)â€“GARCH(1,1) showed slightly lower AIC, residual diagnostics indicated stronger autocorrelation, justifying the retention of the MA(1) term. Forecasts using the selected model provide not only point estimates but also dynamic uncertainty bounds that respond to shifts in volatility. The results demonstrate the importance of modeling both the conditional mean and variance for operational accuracy. In practice, this enhances strategic planning for airlines and air navigation service providers by supporting better resource allocation, risk management, and capacity scaling in response to fluctuating demand uncertainty.
